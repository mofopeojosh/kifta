    <h3 class="product-subtitle">Description</h3>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      KIFTA is seeking an aerodynamicist to join the engineering team. The aerodynamicist will design, build, and test prototype experimental aircraft in a fast-paced research and development environment, and with significant vertical responsibility. The work will span preliminary design, part and assembly design, system design, manufacturing support, and flight test engineering support. Typically, this work includes design of a BWB aircraft with full aerodynamic analysis of the vehicle as a whole, including control surfaces, thrust lines, trim, stability and control. Full scale CFD analysis and wind tunnel testing will also be required.
