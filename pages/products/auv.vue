      Medium Duty AUV
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      The medium-sized AUV is mainly used for submarine search and pipeline inspection, its main task is to cruise along
      the submarine oil and gas pipeline and find the buried, suspended, leaking and other damages of the pipeline. In
      addition, it can also be used for general investigation and marine investigation tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      The AUV can be used to carry out the survey of the medium and shallow water with basic sensors for seabed survey
      and marine surfer. Compared with large AUV system, it has the advantage of moderate volume and weight, good
      operation and maintenance performance. The AUV is equipped with a variable buoyancy device to precisely adjust the
      buoyancy under water, so as to improve the navigation performance and efficiency.

      Large Exploration AUV
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Large UAV unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle can be used in different water depths, with many kinds of tasks,
      wide range of activities, strong mobility, stable and safe platform operation, and can carry a variety of
      professional underwater survey sensors. It can be used in pipeline oil leakage survey, seabed target, drilling
      support, seabed construction detection, life saving and salvage and other integrated underwater tasks.
