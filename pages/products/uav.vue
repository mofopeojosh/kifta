      Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    </h3>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft that carries no human pilot or passengers. UAVs can be fully or
      partially autonomous but are more often controlled remotely by a human pilot.

      UAV Application Scene
    </h3>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Public Security
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Public security work is tense and dangerous. Public
      security and area patrol, emergency rescue, accident
      investigation, criminal search, road monitoring,
      event handling; The advantage of UAV application
      is to reduce the labor intensity and personal risk in
      dangerous environment.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Hydraulic Engineering
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Three big water problems of flood and waterlogging
      disasters, drought and water shortage, water
      environmental pollution restrict the national economy
      and social development. There are many difficulties in
      traditional manual monitoring of wide water surface, long
      river channel, complex terrain environment. UAVs can
      carry out high-efficiency monitoring of water conservancy
      projects and coastal environmental pollution.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Military Service
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      UAV has become an important equipment in many
      fields including national defense and economy. The
      UAV industry are becoming a necessary fusion
      to implement advanced technology into practical
      application.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Surveying and Mapping
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      UAV surveying and mapping can be widely applied
      in engineering construction, emergency and disaster
      management, homeland surveillance, resource
      development, especially in the area of basic surveying,
      land resource survey and monitoring.It has broad
      prospects in the field of construction, the acquisition of
      emergency.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Maritime Affairs
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Fishing disputes, illegal smuggling, sea pollution, boat
      capsizing quite often occurred. The speed of maritime
      inspection boat is low, searching field is small. It takes
      a longer time to execute it. UAV has the advantages
      of wide range, wide field of vision, long time and fast
      response.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Petroleum
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Oil pipelines run hundreds of thousands of kilometers
      long. Pipelines go through complex terrain, such
      as rivers, canyons, mountains, etc. Pipeline leakage
      is the main problems occurred every year. Manual
      inspection is very difficult, especially in the environment
      of complex terrain or natural disasters, long-term
      inspection task and bad weather condition. Drone
      based Inspection has huge advantages of high
      efficiency and less investment.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Forestry
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Forestry is the main body of national ecological
      construction. The forest fire happens many times. To put
      off forest fire, we need manpower, material and financial
      resources. Forest fire causes great damage to forest
      resources and ecological environment, UAV inspection
      can discover fire raising spot in advance, it facilitate
      remedial forest protection.

    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Electric Power
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Along with the expansion of power grid,the inspection
      work is becoming more important in this field.
      Traditional manual inspection needs to turn over
      mountains, high strength, low efficiency, high risk, high
      labor cost and high operating cost; UAV can replace
      man-made high-efficiency inspection, reduce labor
      intensity and job risk.
    </p>
    <h4 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Environmental Protection
    </h4>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Environmental protection relates to the development
      of humanâ€™s future. The Environmental Protection
      Department has stepped up its environmental
      monitoring efforts, but many enterprises have used
      various means to evade and resist, which makes
      environmental protection work facing various difficulties.
      With the innovative application of UAV in the field of
      environmental protection and the continuous progress of
      environmental governance, UAV is trying to normalize the
      law enforcement of UAV in all parts of the country.
