      Remote Operated Vehicle
    </h3>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable underwater vehicles that can be used to explore ocean depths while the
      controller is located somewhere above the water.

      Features and Benefits
    </h4>
    <ul class="list-disc px-5">
      <li>
        Easy launching - recovery vehicle so small weighing only 60 kg fast descent (1000 m in 20 minutes) using a
        disposable ballast optical umbilical
        cable very thin, durable, reusable, buoyant, strong
      </li>
      <li>
        Operation mode 1: eyeball vehicle hanging on the umbilical cable, yawing and moving horizontally by remotely
        operated propulsion and adjusting depth by acting on umbilical cable pay out or take up operation mode 2:
        following ballast release, the vehicle acquires full ROV manoeuvrability in the water volume,
        taking advantage of the low drag umbilical cable only 3.5 mm diameter and slightly floatable so that it
        always sets above the vehicle
      </li>
      <li>
        “Swan head”, multisensory head capable of pan, tilt and articulated neck elevation, allowing swan like all
        round views
      </li>
      <li>Battery powered vehicle allows 8 hours average inspection time</li>
      <li>Fast return to surface (1000 m in 20 minutes) and easy recovery</li>
      <li>
        Wide range of sensors and options including manipulator arms, fish traps, sediment and soil sampling tools,
        laser gauge, and more…

      Detailed description of some parts of the ROV
    </p>
    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Pilot Console
    </h5>
    <p>
      Flat screen for video image and overlay of navigation data, alarms, system information, sonar displays. Two
      joysticks for manual vehicle driving, one lever for cable control, acoustic beeper to warn the pilot of the cable
      unrolling or winding up.
      Push buttons and toggles to control other functions.The pilot can choose Manual steering acting on two joysticks
      or to select one or more automatic controls: depth, course and speed. In this case joysticks are used to set
      desired automatic values and pilot hands are free. An optional computer can take full control for true robotic
      missions.

      Vehicle
    </h5>
    <p>
      The main body is an assembly of six carbon fibres pressure resistant cylinders, four of them housing high power
      batteries, the other two cylinders are packing the electronics. No floatation foam is used.
      The “SWAN head” is a very small movable head that allows looking all around. It is supported by a long articulated
      neck is an extremely flexible sensor package combining full High Definition TV camcorder with integral 20
      Megapixel still camera and corrected viewport, a relocation-navigation sonar, LED floodlight and a laser gauge.
      The propulsion is based on 4 pressure compensated brushless motors in a typical PLUTO configuration, two
      horizontal thrusters for forward-reverse and yawing movements plus two vertical vectored thrusters for up-down and
      side shift. No silt is being lifted by propellers.
