      Distributed Sensing Technology For Power Cable Monitoring System
    </h3>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Distributed sensing technology has been prevalent in the power and utility sector since the 1980s and the largest
      area where this technology is commonly used is in the power cable monitoring. Distributed sensing technology
      includes

      Distributed Temperature Sensing Applications for Power Cable Monitoring
    </h3>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      The applications for distributed temperature sensing in power cable monitoring includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc px-5">
      <li>
        Real time thermal rating of cables (also known as dynamic cable rating). This has primarily been for buried
        cables, sub-sea cables and cable tunnels but there also has been applications for overhead cables
      </li>
      <li>Hot spot detection</li>
      <li>
        Fire detection for cables – this has primarily been for cable tunnels where at times there are personnel in
        the vicinity of the cable

      <nuxt-link class="app-link" to="/technology/distributed-temperature-sensing">
        distributed temperature sensing
      </nuxt-link>
      , one of the key factors in the configuration of the system has been the position of the fiber optic sensing cable
      in relation to the power cable. Ideally the DTS fiber optic sensing element would be located within the
      construction of the power cable itself. However, this is not always practical (either due to cable construction
      design or installation issues around splice joints) and so in many cases the DTS fiber sensing element is attached
      to the surface of the power cable configuration (or in the vicinity).

      is a more recent development but acceptance is growing quickly within the power cable monitoring segment. Some of
      the key applications which are building interest includes:
    </p>

    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Asset life extension of overhead cables
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Security and threat prevention for buried cables which include third party interference. This includes both
      accidental damage (3rd party construction) and malicious damage (terrorism, theft…..).
    </p>

    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Security for overhead cables particularly metal theft from the towers. If a fiber optic is installed in the ground
      cable (OPGW), or other elements, this can detect any vibrations in the supporting framework and can pinpoint which
      tower is being targeted.
    </p>

    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Galloping Power Lines
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      The prediction and early detection of line galloping in overhead cables due to weather events.
    </p>
    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Fault Detection
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Instantaneous fault detection and detection of partial discharge events in both buried and cable tunnels. A
      partial discharge event or other cable failure typically has an acoustic signature which can be located which
      means rapid maintenance can be carried out to minimise downtime.
    </p>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      The location of subsea cables. Using triangulation, of acoustic sources on the surface (boat with acoustic
      sounder) or seabed (acoustic beacons), the profile of the cable can be calculated and any cable movement can be
      measured. Preventative action can therefore be taken if the cable integrity is at risk.
    </p>

    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Substation Condition Monitoring
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      The vibration and condition monitoring of substation and ancillary equipment.

      , there have been a number of applications for distributed strain monitoring, including:
    </p>

    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Asset life extension of overhead cables
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      By monitoring the strain/sag of the optical ground wire and comparing versus the expected extension (vs life in
      service), justifications can be made to extend the lifetime of the overhead lines.
    </p>

    <h5 class="product-subtitle-sm">
      Galloping Power Lines
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Dynamic strain can be measure in the optical ground wire during extreme weather events and fatigue calculations
      can be made vs theoretical calculations. This can be used either for life extension calculations or as part of a
      preventative maintenance strategy.

      Power cable Installation monitoring
    </h5>
    <p class="product-paragraph">
      Based on data obtained from 28 UK offshore wind insurance losses between 2002 and 2015 with a total value of
      £212.7m, 68% of the losses are reported to be cable faults which occurred predominately during the construction
      phase. The failures were due to mechanical damage with a number of causes including over‐bending during load out
      and installation, excessive tension during load out and installation and crushing during post‐lay burial. By
      actively monitoring strain during installation – care can be taken to reduce strains and prevent mechanical damage
      to the cables.

        Real Time Thermal Rating

      is a methodology used within the power and utility sector to assess operational thermal rating of equipment. This
      includes assets such as:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc px-5">
      <li>Underground and subsea cables</li>

      <nuxt-link class="app-link" to="/technology/real-time-thermal-rating">
        Real time thermal rating

      systems typically use real-time data taken from real environment conditions and loading rather than relying on
      conservative theoretical assumptions. RTTR provides additional information on system capacity (or thermal
      headroom). RTTR systems are able to indicate whether areas are stressed (overheated) or in fact have more capacity
      than originally anticipated.
